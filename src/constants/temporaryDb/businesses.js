        "OVERVIEW: Owning a Small Business is incredibly rewarding, but also very challenging. The smaller your business is, the more resource constraints you encounter. When trying to grow, one of the biggest tradeoffs is between time and money. This is especially true with marketing. There are many marketing channels. You can market directly to customers (B2C) with referral programs (word of mouth), social media and email funnels, and paid advertising (print or virtual). You can also market to other businesses to build through their customer base (B2B). Each has their own strengths and weaknesses with reach, time commitment, and cost. CHALLENGE:  You are a small business owner offering personal services (choose one that interest you or default to personal training to help MATRIX) and you need to increase your clientele. You have limited resources (time and money). If you do things yourself, the advertising budget is bigger but the time constraint is greater and each new client requires more time. If you pay someone to help, the advertising budget is lower but there is more time to handle the new clients. What audience would you target for growth? What marketing strategy or mix of strategies would you choose to grow your business? Explain why you think this would work best.  Adjusting your strategy is common in a small business. What criteria would you use to know if and when adjustments are needed? How would the criteria inform you about ways to change your strategy? ", // actual challenge description + instructions
